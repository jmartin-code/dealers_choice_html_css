                When you're looking for the top sushi in NYC, here's where to go. These are the omakase spots where you'll feel like you're at a day spa, the neighborhood staples that go above and beyond, and the restaurants where you can and should be celebrating birthdays. Are some of these places wildly expensive? Absolutely. But there are also a few options on this list where you can get out for under $50. No matter what you're paying, you can be confident that it's worth it. Are you just looking to spend $30 and call it a night? We have you covered there as well.

                The cheapest meal at Sushi Noz costs $250—and it's worth the price. This $250, nigiri-dominated meal happens in the so-called Ash Room and comes with three appetizers, 15 pieces, and miso soup. There’s also a more deluxe $400 version that can only be administered by Chef Noz himself. Generally, the selection of sushi at Noz runs traditional, which means a night here is all about the careful preparation and multi-sensory experience of sitting in a smoky cypress room. We've especially loved baby bluefin tuna that's only caught in the winter, salmon roe served in a 200-year-old bowl, and eel that's smoked over bamboo leaves then dabbed with a mixture of braising liquid made with eel, sugar, and apples.</p>

                This East Village restaurant almost exclusively uses ingredients found within the United States. They dole out bigeye tuna from North Carolina, striper raised in Bushwick, and incredible fluke sashimi that was caught so close to Rosella it could have taken the afternoon train from Montauk while enjoying a tallboy in a brown paper bag. If you’ve been carrying around the misconception that American fish is only for guys on Hinge to pose with in their profile pictures, come to this luxurious-but-lowkey restaurant, eat some Washington State Arctic Char over a bed of California-grown rice, and be proven wrong. An à la carte meal at Rosella will be the highlight of your week (and run you around $50), but the $150 omakase is particularly impressive.</p>

                At $420 a pop, Shion 69 Leonard Street is one of the most expensive omakases in the city. The price tag alone makes it intriguing for a special occasion—but throwing back sake and singing "Happy Birthday" here would be akin to doing TikTok dances in a museum. This place is for one of those mature milestones, the kind that are straight out of a Neil Young song, when you want to sit and reflect on life, make peace with past failures and ones who got away. And you'll get about 15 minutes to do that, before it's time to pay attention. Between the peaceful room, precise salt-curing, and rhythmic pace of hot and cold plates, this meal will demand your presence like it's the cult leader of a silent meditation retreat.</p>

                This party spot in Jackson Heights runs four nightly sushi omakase seatings, each with 15 pieces of nigiri, a couple of appetizers, and unlimited sake for $89 in cold hard cash. A meal here doesn’t so much feel like a typical omakase experience as it does a reckless basement party with songs like “Sweet Home Alabama” blasting from the speakers. Whenever a diner’s cup empties, the owner tips a magnum of sake into their glass, and tops off his own cup for good measure. After about two pours, the people sitting next to you at the sushi bar will begin to loosen up. Then you can all sing along to “Mambo No. 5” together while you eat what the chef claims is weed-infused salmon smoking underneath one of those Beauty and the Beast glass covers. Jury is still out on whether he was fibbing.</p>

                We always recommend Sushi Katsuei to anyone looking for a terrific, creative omakase that they can eat without feeling like Mr. Monopoly. This Park Slope restaurant opened in 2014, and then subsequently expanded to the West Village in 2017. Omakases at both locations start around $60 for nine pieces and a handroll, often highlighting unusual pieces like firefly squid or barracuda (plus more typical fan favorites like toro or uni). You could always order à la carte or level up and try the 15-ish course omakase for around $120, but the $60 deal feels sweetest to us.</p>
